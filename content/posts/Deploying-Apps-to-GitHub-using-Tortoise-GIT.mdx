## Benefits of using Tortoisegit

- Tortoisegit makes it easier to clone a repository
- Tortoisegit makes it easier to upload your code from your laptop to your repository online easily with a single command line.
- Extremely easy to pull from your online repository to update your local if you are working on a collaboration project with the click of a button.
- This tool makes it easy to remove all un-tracked files from your local with the click of a button.
- And a lot more that can be found on the link below:

## How To connect TortoiseGit with Github

- Go to [github.com](http://github.com) and login
- Create a new Repository.

  />
</div>

- Create a remote Github repo and name it.

    height={200}
  />
</div>
<small clasName="text-gray-100">
  Mine has already been created so i will work with that, Just put in the name
  thatâ€™s all. Then click OK.
</small>

- Copy the line containing your project link : https://github.com/Developerayo/My-Project-testing-tortiseGIT-.git

<div className="flex justify-center">
  <Img
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1551557113/3.png"
    alt="Deploying Apps to GitHub using TortoiseGIT"
    width={300}
    height={200}
  />
</div>

## Now lets head over to the TortoiseGit we installed earlier.

<div className="flex justify-center">
  <Img
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1551557111/4.png"
    alt="Deploying Apps to GitHub using TortoiseGIT"
    width={300}
    height={200}
  />
</div>

Once you have got that all opened, click on generate then move the mouse all around the box to make it go faster

After clicking on generate, you will have a box like this below

<div className="flex justify-center">
  <Img
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1551557112/5.png"
    alt="Deploying Apps to GitHub using TortoiseGIT"
    width={300}
    height={200}
  />
</div>

THE LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS BELOW

ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEAq0jmbEdOeDHZBcD8o8FvUv1lCUBJJmM0DpHz+
nn7SzT4CT2PHcOBken+9L2Zz9D7bopmx033DX3/

0PJg4cpOkRSFJTgI3tY4cNTWr5kTZdBONEMI+
QGNtpWwr774S

Once you have this, save it in a secure file.

Do not forget you copied the link from GITHUB that has your project repository link, now lets put that in use:

<mark clasName="bg-purple-300 text-white">
  https://github.com/Developerayo/My-Project-testing-tortiseGIT-.git
</mark>

Create a folder on desktop and name it. Mine is named Code, then create a file in the folder, Mine is named myproject. Create a text file named hi.txt and put some text in it.

lets move on to putting the github link to use

<div className="flex justify-center">
  <Img
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1551557113/6.png"
    alt="Deploying Apps to GitHub using TortoiseGIT"
    width={300}
    height={200}
  />
</div>
<small clasName="text-gray-100">
  Now you see the hi.txt file we created, in the message box put in initial
  commit then click ok
</small>

<div className="flex justify-center">

    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1551557111/7.png"
    alt="Deploying Apps to GitHub using TortoiseGIT"
    width={300}
    height={200}
  />
</div>

Now lets go back to that created Repo on GITHUB

Remember the link you copied from github

<mark className="bg-purple-300 text-white ">
  https://github.com/Developerayo/My-Project-testing-tortiseGIT-.git
</mark>

let us make use of that.

Right click on the folder you created mine is named â€˜myprojectâ€™, then click on tortoisegit, followed by the push selection at the top of the list.

<div className="flex justify-center">
  <Img
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1551557114/8.png"

    width={300}
    height={200}
  />
</div>

## How to setup the PUSH dialog with Github

</div>
<small clasName="text-gray-100">Fill in the dialog</small>

- Remote: Origin
- URL: your github url you copied earlier mine is https://github.com/Developerayo/My-Project-testing-tortiseGIT-.git\
- The the ssh or putty key you saved earlier, you would have to add that file here from were you saved it
- CLICK ADD NEW

    height={200}
  />
</div>
<small clasName="text-gray-100">
